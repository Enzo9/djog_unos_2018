# Social

These are more specific social rules than [the code of conduct](../code_of_conduct.md).

## S.1. Never assign yourself a second Issue

### Reason

Everyone should have the same opportunity of picking an Issue. 

### Exceptions

Richel may assign you a second/third/etc. Issue. There will be a good reason for that.

## S.2. Never modify other people's topic branches

### Reason

Your topic branch is your personal version. It's personal. It's yours. People must respect that.

### Exceptions 

If you may do so, if you have been given permission on a GitHub Issue.

### Note

You may merge other people's topic branches in `develop` without permission.
