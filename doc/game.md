# Game

Information about the game: Nature Zen.

Original idea from [here](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018/issues/2#issuecomment-420010313):

> A game which consists of tiles that look like coth. (See picture.)
> In this game, the different patterns on the cloth represent different types of worlds, such as forests, cities, oceans, rivers, mountains.
> Main Features (Not everything)
> 
> * The player can move these tiles to alter the world and the creatures who live on it.
> * The player can interact with the creatures, for example, kill them, send them to a different location etc.
> * On the bottom of the world, there is a 'dark side' and the player can turn each tile over to reveal the dark side and maybe harm the creatures on top in some way.
> * The world's amount of tiles is finite but gradually increasing, the empty places consist of an endless pit the creatures can fall in. (A finite amount of tiles is handy to make it less complicated for the player to move the tiles.)
> 
> Extra Features
> 
> * The player can zoom in on a tile and see more tiles on that tile
> * Create enemies: People (Because the game is about the "Nature Zen")
> * More detailed worlds with planets etc.
> * Draw graphics
